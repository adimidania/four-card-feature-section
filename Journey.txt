FIRST THING FIRST :
So for this one, I will try to follow the mobile first approach, and use more semantic elements
to avoid accessibility issues. Also, I will try my hard to follow the style-guide.md this time.
AFTER LOOKING AT THE GIVEN DESIGN PICTURES :
For the desktop versiom, I will be using Grid (I'm not really used to it, all of my previous projects were
build using flexbox, so that will be a challenge for me :D)
