FIRST THING FIRST :

So for this one, I will try to follow the mobile first approach, and use more semantic elements
to avoid accessibility issues. Also, I will try my hard to follow the style-guide.md this time.
AFTER LOOKING AT THE GIVEN DESIGN PICTURES :
For the desktop versiom, I will be using Grid (I'm not really used to it, all of my previous projects were
build using flexbox, so that will be a challenge for me :D)

FINISHED :
Well, at first, I was a bit scared of css grid layout, they seemed to be a bit
complicated, but actually, they are pretty easy to understand, and also useful! 
I think I will be using them so often!
I'm feeling pretty satisfied now :) 


OUTAKES :
1. Useful website for learning about box-shadow property : https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/.
2. CSS Grid Layout.
3. Border top along with border radius.

QUESTIONS :
1. Is it correct to let the card have a fixed width and height? like when we resize the browser, at some points,
the width and the height doesn't change, is it acceptable? or do we need to let its width and height change according 
to the widht and the height of the screen ? because for me, I always let them be fixed, and tbh is much easier for me!
